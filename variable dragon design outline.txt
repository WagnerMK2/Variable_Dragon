situation 1
	key off/car off
		board should be off, no power draw
		acc should be low
situation 2
	key on/ engine off
		intital car turn on before start
		battery voltage should be less than 12.9VDC
		acc should be high
		blade should close on starting this cycle for quiet cold starts
		map sensor should be around ambient. indicating <high load> 
		mode switch active OFF/AUTO/ON
			OFF keeps valve closed and occasionally tries to close valve for maintainace
			ON opens valve with no logic
			AUTO closes valve if open, occasionally attempts closing valve.
situation 3
	key on/ engine on
		battery should be over 13.2VDC
		acc should be high
		map sensor active for use
		mode switch active OFF/AUTO/ON
			OFF keeps valve closed and occasionally tries to close valve for maintainace
				both switch inputs low
				if both mode digital input == off with error led mode
				no led status light
			ON opens valve with no logic
				sends one digital inputs
				RED status led
			AUTO uses map sensor and battery voltage to decide on when to open/close valve
				open above 92% load for 1.34 sec when status == closed, close below 75% load for 1 sec when status == open,
				sends one digital input
				
				
				
				
opening cycle
	opening output high
		relay logic should prevent open and close working at the same time 1NC/1NO
		status led should flash when valve is moving
	monitor for overamperage
		if overamp, stop movement
			indicate overamp == error led activate
closing cycle
	closing output high
		relay logic should prevent open and close working at the same time 1NC/1NO
		staus led should flash when valve is moving
	monitor for over amperage
		if overamp, stop movement
			indicate overamp == error led activate
